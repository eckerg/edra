  <title>To the boundless deep you lead me</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 To the boundless deep You lead me,
 at my side You dispel all my fears.
 I will praise my rock and  my fortress;
 O my God you're the strength of my life!
 To the boundless deep You lead me,
 in your presence the night disappers.
 I will praise my rock and  my fortress;
 O my God you're the strength of my life

[V1]
 You are my rock, You are my fortress;           
 You are the one on whom I depend.   
 You have preserved me from falling in darkness,
 struck off the chains of death from my soul.

[V2]
 When I cried out in my distresses,           
 You came to save me from my despair.
 When I was cast into the deepest of dungeons,
 You came to draw me in to the light!

[V3]
 You clothe me, Lord, with your own glory,           
 and with your love You give me your strength. 
 I sing your praise and will bless You for ever;
 I will not cease to honour your name.

[V4]
 For You my God nothing is hopeless;           
 be cause your ways are far above mine. 
 With You alone I can face any danger;
 in You O Lord I put all my trust.</lyrics>
