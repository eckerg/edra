    title: This is the body and blood
    verses:
      - name: c
        lines:
          - This is the body and blood of our Lord.
          - The cup of our salvation and the bread of life.
          - Eternal God gives Himself as our food
          - That all who believe in Him may have life.
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Just before the Lord went to the Father
          - He took bread and wine, broke it for us.
          - Through the gift of His blood and His body,
          - We know we will not hunger again.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - Jesus shares Himself for all the nations,
          - He is the bread of life for the world.
          - And through Him we are now all God’s children.
          - In His sacrifice He’s glorified.
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - With the eyes of our Faith we see Jesus,
          - Truly here in the bread and the wine.
          - By His dying and rising we’re now free,
          - To give all of our life to our King!
      - name: v4
        lines:
          - Let us sing out our praises unending,
          - For the marvels that He’s done for us.
          - Through His body and blood which is given,
          - Jesus pours His own love in our hearts.
