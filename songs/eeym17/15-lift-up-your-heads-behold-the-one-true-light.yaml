        lines:
          - Lift up your heads, behold the one true light â€“
          - here is the Christ, here is the Prince of Peace.
          - Lift up your hearts, receive the gift of mercy.
          - Our Savior comes, our Savior dwells with us.
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Jesus Christ, the Son of God made Man
          - among his own, comes to make a home.
          - Come and see, behold Emmanuel,
          - He is with us, the Word of God made flesh.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - Come o Lord! Your temple is made ready.
          - Your word is food, our hearts will take their fill.
          - Speak o Lord! Your servants come to hear,
          - Your children Lord, your children Lord are we.
