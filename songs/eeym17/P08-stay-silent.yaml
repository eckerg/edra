    verses:
      - name: c
        lines:
          - Stay silent,
          - unless what you have to say
          - is greater than the beauty
          - of the silence of the Lord.
          - Stay silent,
          - unless what you have to say
          - is greater than the silence of the Lord.
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Draw me Jesus to the silence of your heart;
          - take me away from my fears.
          - Many worries of the world hinder me;
          - here in your presence they leave me.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - All my being finds itself in Your truth.
          - I see the scars of my sins, Lord;
          - revelation of my woundednature.
          - All of my heart longs for You, Lord.
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - Help me Jesus find my true desires,
          - settle the storm of my emo tions.
          - Enlighten my mind with Your wisdom di vine,
          - to know Your will for my life, Lord.
      - name: v4
        lines:
          - Here you look with so much love upon me;
          - Your love and mercy sets me free.
          - I lift my eyes adoring to your face,
          - and see the beauty of Your grace.
