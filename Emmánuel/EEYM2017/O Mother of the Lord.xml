  <title>O Mother of the Lord</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 O mother of the Lord, our Lady and Queen.
 God shaped, within your womb, the maker of man.
 Through you, Holy Light has come to dwell among us.
 Mary, you are the joy of God:
 his chosen from all mankind.

[V1]
 Mary full of grace, gladly we greet you.
 On you has shone down the glory of the Lord.
 Heaven has showered us with grace,
 O Mary pray for us: unfading Morning Star.

[V2]
 Mary full of grace, Ark of the Promise,
 From your womb has come the Son of God made flesh.
 In you dwells our Emmanuel,
 O Mary pray for us: true temple of our Lord.

[V3]
 Mary full of grace, Queen of the Heavens.
 For our sake your bore the King of all the World.
 Through you the Saviour is revealed,
 O Mary pray for us: beloved spouse of God.

[V4]
 Mary full of grace, Purest of Virgins!
 You have given life to Him who made us all.
 In you the heavens come to earth,
 O Mary pray for us: our mother without stain.

[V5]
 Mary full of grace, Refuge of Sinners.
 God makes new in you the whole of humankind
 In you the Saviour made his home,
 O Mary pray for us: our new and sinless Eve.

[V6]
 Mary full of grace, God's humble servant,
 Generations praise and magnify your name.
 The Holy Spirit came on you,
 O Mary pray for us: all ages call you blest.

[V7]
 Mary full of grace, Queen of the Angels.
 With your holy Son, you reign upon the earth.
 Seated in splendour on your throne,
 O Mary pray for us: beloved of the saints.</lyrics>
