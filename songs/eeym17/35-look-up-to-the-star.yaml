    order: [v1, c, v2, c, v3, c, v4, c, b, c]
    verses:
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - If the wind brings darker news of temptation.
          - If youâ€™re cast upon the rocks of your cares.
          - If you cannot fight the waves of ambition,
          - And the storms of passion drown of your prayers.
      - name: c
        lines:
          - Look up to the star, call Mary by name,
          - Follow her voice, be not afraid.
          - Look up to the star, call Mary by name,
          - Trust, she will lead you on the way.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - When in anguish and in doubt you lose your way,
          - When the darkness of despair covers you.
          - When you're faced with memories of all your faults,
          - And the thought of being judged tortures you.
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - If your soul is overcome with avarice,
          - Overwhelmed by what it sees jealously.
          - If your heart is swallowed up and all is lost,
          - And you're drowned beneath your own misery.
      - name: v4
        lines:
          - Shining out across the sea as our guiding Star,
          - Showing from afar the port that you seek.
          - For her rays shine pure and strong over all the Earth,
          - In the Heavens high above, in the deep.
      - name: b
        lines:
          - Follow her voice, you will never stray.
          - Call on her name, she will strengthen you.
          - Be not afraid, with you she will stay.
          - True to the port, she is guiding you.
