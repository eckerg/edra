  <title>Lift up your heads, behold the one true light</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 Lift up your heads, behold the one true light â€“ 
 here is the Christ, here is the Prince of Peace. 
 Lift up your hearts, receive the gift of mercy. 
 Our Savior comes, our Savior dwells with us.

[V1]
 Jesus Christ, the Son of God made Man
 among his own, comes to make a home. 
 Come and see, behold Emmanuel,
 He is with us, the Word of God made flesh.

[V2]
 Come o Lord! Your temple is made ready.
 Your word is food, our hearts will take their fill. 
 Speak o Lord! Your servants come to hear, 
 Your children Lord, your children Lord are we. </lyrics>
