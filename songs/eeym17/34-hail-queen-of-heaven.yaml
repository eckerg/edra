    verses:
      - name: c
        lines:
          - Hail Queen of Heav’n,
          - You are beyond compare,
          - Mary, full of grace, enrob’d with the sun,
          - Crown’d with the stars the moon is at your feet,
          - For our salvation’s dawn,
          - We have received in you.
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Mother Mary new Eve,
          - you’re the joy of our Lord,
          - You gave birth to our God,
          - our Saviour Jesus Christ.
          - You have opened to us,
          - all we lost through our sin;
          - guide us all on our way,
          - bright star of the morn.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - Mary, you still believed,
          - at the foot of the cross.
          - Keep us firm in our hope,
          - protect our faith in Him.
          - From the side of your Son,
          - you have drawn for us all,
          - Streams of life and of grace
          - poured out for all the world.
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - O the great joy of Eve,
          - when you were lifted up,
          - Higher than all the angels,
          - ev’n higher than the clouds.
          - Mother Mary our Queen,
          - o how great is our joy,
          - Contemplating in you
          - the promise of God’s life.
      - name: v4
        lines:
          - O Immaculate Queen,
          - virgin free from all sin,
          - With your body and soul,
          - you entered into heav’n.
          - You were carried in glory,
          - Queen of heaven you’re blest,
          - You will welcome us all,
          - the day when we see God.
