  <lyrics>[C]
 All my soul, all my heart and being,
 Praise the Lord, without end!
 All my soul, all my heart and being,
 Praise the Lord, praise his Holy Name, 
 Without end, praise his Holy Name!

[V1]
 Nations cry out with joy and sing!
 Come and rejoice: the Lord is King!
 Great is the glory of his name,
 Faithful and mighty is his reign.

[V2]
 For all your wonders we give praise.
 You've overcome your enemies.
 All of the earth bows down to You,
 King of all ages, just and true.

[V3]
 You lead us through the deadly sea,
 Singing a new song, “We are free”. 
 By your right hand and mighty arm,
 You keep us safe from every harm.

[V4]
 We will return and dwell with You,
 Telling the world your Name is true.
 All of our joy by You is giv'n,
 Reign in our hearts, Lord King of heav'n!</lyrics>
