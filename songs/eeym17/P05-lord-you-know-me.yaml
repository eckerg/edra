    title: Lord, You Know Me
    verses:
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Lord, you know me, and you search the secrets of my heart.
          - Sometimes I run and try to hide
          - though you're here by my side.
          - My aching heart, this weary pain,
          - Lord, I call your holy name.
          - You know when I sit and when I rise,
          - tender love shining from your eyes.
      - name: c
        lines:
          - 'And you say:'
          - I know. I know.
          - I died for you, I rose for you,
          - my Spirit I gave to you.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - Lord, you know me, and you search the secrets of my heart.
          - Sometimes I run and try to hide
          - though you're here by my side.
          - You don't condemn but you guide,
          - darkness can't hide from love divine.
          - Oh, Spirit of power, on me descend;
          - my sinful soul, you be friend.
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - Lord, you know me, and you search the secrets of my heart.
          - Sometimes I run and try to hide
          - though you're here by my side.
          - Eternal life, I purely seek,
          - Open my heart when I am weak
          - so if my steps should go astray;
          - lead me in your eternal way.
      - name: v32
        lines:
          - For I shall not be afraid,
          - I'm wonderfully made.
          - Wonderfully made, wonderfully made,
          - wonderfully made am I.
          - Wonderfully made, wonderfully made,
          - wonderfully made am I.
      - name: c2
        lines:
          - "'Cause I know. I know."
          - You died for me. You rose for me.
          - Your Spirit sets me free.
