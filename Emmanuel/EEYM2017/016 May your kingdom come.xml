  <title>May your kingdom come</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 May your kingdom come,
 May your name be always praised,
 Here on earth as in heavâ€™n,
 May your will be done today.
 The Spirit of truth
 Like a torrent pour on us,
 Pour your holiness on us,
 Build our faith, our hope, our love.

[V1]
 Who could come between us, Lord,
 And the love that you have for us?
 Who could turn away from You,
 From your tenderness, o Lord?

[V2]
 In our praise you come to dwell.
 You inspire us in our prayer.
 Lord, you draw us near to You.
 In your presence we are one.

[B]
 From evil Lord, set us free,
 Grant us your peace in our day !
 Deliver us, from our sin ;
 Show us your mercy and grace !
 Protect us, Lord, from all fear ;
 We wait in joy and in hope !
 Your reign on earth is at hand :
 The coming of Jesus Christ.

[V3]
 So the Lord will be our light 
 And dispel the night forever.
 On our lips will be his name
 And our tears will be no more.</lyrics>
