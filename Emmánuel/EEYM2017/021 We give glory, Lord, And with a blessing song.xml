  <lyrics>[C]
 We give glory, Lord, 
 And with a blessing song,
 Little children sure 
 Of their Fatherâ€™s love,
 We proclaim our hope, 
 Voices joined as one,
 Together honour your name.

[V1]
 Holy Lord, You stretch out your hand,
 Giving life and hope to the earth.
 In the night, the true light shines out,
 Word of God, the lamp of our path!

[V2]
 Let the peoples sing out their joy,
 Let the nations follow your ways,
 Let the priests proclaim your decrees:
 Bless, o Lord, this people of praise.

[V3]
 As the earth has yielded its fruit,
 So our God has blessed us once more.
 From the dawn to setting of sun,
 Let the nations come to adore.</lyrics>
