  <lyrics>[C]
 Father glory be to your name,
 Jesus glory to You the Saviour of all.
 Holy Spirit, glory to You.
 Honour glory and praise, blessed Trinity.

[v1]
 Father of all, God of kindness and love,
 You fill us with your grace and your gifts.
 Weâ€™re made for You so we give You our hearts,
 we bless You O Lord, to You all honour and praise.

[v2]
 Jesus our Lord, Son of God the most high,
 We long to give You honour and thanks
 Jesus, your heart, open for all the world,
 Reveals the great love of God the Father for all.

[v3]
 Spirit of God, heal and purify us,
 And lead us to the fulness of truth.
 Come visit us and enlighten our souls
 And open the doors so we'll proclaim the Good News.</lyrics>
