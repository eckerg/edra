    title: Only by grace
    verses:
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - All my being searches,
          - From where will my help come?
          - From my Lord and Saviour,
          - The Fathers only Son.
          - In all my distresses,
          - He comes to set me free.
          - He is ever faithful,
          - For all eternity.
      - name: c
        lines:
          - Only by grace,
          - Can I approach your holy throne.
          - Only by grace,
          - Can I be welcomed home.
          - You paid the price,
          - A new creation comes to be.
          - Through your rising from the dead,
          - You set your people free.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - You know all my thoughts, Lord,
          - And You know all my fears.
          - Even from the womb, Lord,
          - Yes, You were always near.
          - You forgive the sinner,
          - Unbounded love you give.
          - Wonderful you mercy,
          - In your light I shall live.
