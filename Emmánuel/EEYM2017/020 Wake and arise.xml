  <lyrics>[C]
 Wake and arise, come to the light, people of God.
 Jesus the Lord has been born for us all.
 Glory to God, peace to the earth,
 sing to the Lord, bow adore Him now.

[V1]
 Our Redeemer and Lord, who was promised to us, brings us
 fullness of life. Let's acclaim the king, Jesus our Lord.

[V2]
 Your great love is so strong,
 Even stronger than death.
 You have saved us from sin,
 Let's acclaim the king, Jesus our Lord.

[V3]
 God the Father of all,
 Sent his Son, Jesus Christ,
 He became man like us,
 Let's acclaim the king, Jesus our Lord.

[V4]
 God our rock and strength,
 Source of life and of hope,
 Came to us as a child,
 Let's acclaim the king, Jesus our Lord.

[V5]
 Throughout all of the world,
 A great light shines on us,
 God is here with us now,
 Let's acclaim the king, Jesus our Lord.</lyrics>
