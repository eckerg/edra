          - Give praise to God’s holy name!
          - Give praise, you servants of the Lord!
          - Praise the Lord, for he is good!
          - Celebrate the gentleness of God!
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Come ring out all our joy! Here is our Lord!
          - Hail the Lord God our rock, true salvation He brings!
          - Let us come unto Him, give Him our thanks,
          - With our song and our dance, offer praise to the King!
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - God is mighty and strong, He is our Lord.
          - King above all the gods, all the mountains are his.
          - In his hands are the depths, all of the earth,
          - And the land and the sea by his own hand were made.
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - Let us enter his house, bow and bend low.
          - Let us kneel before Him, He alone is our God.
          - To his pasture we come, He is our guide,
          - We belong to the flock that is led by his hand.
      - name: v4
        lines:
          - Hear the word of the Lord! Ponder his law!
          - Do not harden your hearts, listen now to his voice!
          - Keep us close to You, Lord, steadfast and true,
          - 'Strengthen us in our faith: all our hope is in You!'
