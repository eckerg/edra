  <title>Hosanna</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 I see the King of glory
 Coming on the clouds with fire
 The whole earth shakes
 The whole earth shakes
 I see His love and mercy
 Washing over all our sin
 The people sing
 The people sing

[C]
 Hosanna Hosanna
 Hosanna in the highest
 Hosanna Hosanna
 Hosanna in the highest

[V2]
 I see a generation
 Rising up to take their place
 With selfless faith
 With selfless faith
 I see a near revival
 Stirring as we pray and seek
 We’re on our knees
 We’re on our knees

[B]
 Heal my heart and make it clean
 Open up my eyes to the things unseen
 Show me how to love
 Like You have loved me
 Break my heart for what breaks Yours
 Everything I am
 For Your kingdom’s cause
 As I walk from earth into eternity
