    title: Jerusalem, our heavenly home
    verses:
      - name: c
        lines:
          - I saw the Holy City come from God,
          - Bride of the Lamb, and Glory of the Lord.
          - 'I saw the Holy City come from God:'
          - Jerusalem, our heaven’ly home.
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - The glory of the Lord shall give light,
          - No further need of sun or of moon.
          - The night is past and will be no more.
          - The Lamb will be the light that they need.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - Behold God’s dwelling is in our midst.
          - He will wipe every tear from our eyes
          - And death and mourning will be no more.
          - All former things have come to an end.
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - Salvation, pow’r and glory to God!
          - The Lord our God, the Almighty reigns!
          - Let us rejoice, exult and give praise!
          - This is the wedding feast of the Lamb!
