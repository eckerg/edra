  <title>For You, o Lord</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 For You, o Lord, I sing my song of joy; 
 How great You are, o my God! 
 With all my heart, I give You honour and thanks, 
 I offer You endless praise.

[V1]
 See I stand before You Lord, 
 Prepared to follow your way.
 In your hand I put my trust; 
 Take me Lord!

[V2]
 Lord, I lift my hands on high, 
 I praise your glorious name ;
 You have taught my lips to sing 
 Of your praise!

[V3]
 For your glory, Lord, is great, 
 And great your marvels for me;
 By your light You have dispelled 
 All my fears!

[V4]
 I will never cease to praise, 
 Proclaim and honour You Lord;
 For your glory I will sing, 
 Holy Lord!</lyrics>
