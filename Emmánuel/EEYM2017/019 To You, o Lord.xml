  <title>To You, o Lord</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 To You, o Lord, we sing with all our hearts,
 In You the victory is won.
 We fix our eyes on You, we contemplate your cross,
 You are the Lamb, Godâ€™s only Son.

[V1]
 You clear a path when all is dark,
 Our hope is born again in You.
 We have no fear, we follow where You lead,
 You are our peace and You are true.

[V2]
 In all our struggles and our woes,
 For us your victory is won. 
 Even in danger, Father, we believe,
 Through Jesus Christ, your only Son.

[V3]
 Deep in the secret of our hearts,
 Make of your truth our one desire.
 Teach us, o Lord, the wisdom of your ways,
 And with your love set us on fire!</lyrics>
