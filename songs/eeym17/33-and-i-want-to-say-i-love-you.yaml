    title: And I want to say I love you
    verses:
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - O Mother Mary, your love is so true.
          - Its faithfulness draws me closer to you.
          - And when I cry and I’m lost from the fold.
          - I know that you will never lose your hold.
          - You gave your “Yes” to the Word of the Lord.
          - And God himself in your womb took his form.
          - Now that you’re crowned in the heavens above,
          - You’ll carry me home by the grace of his love.
      - name: c
        lines:
          - And I want to say "I love you".
          - And I need to say "I love you".
          - Now just let me say that I’ll love you
          - For all eternity.
          - For all eternity.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - God’s call, at times, seems so daunting to me.
          - I ask myself how it ever will be.
          - But when I ponder the Gospel with you,
          - You give me faith and his Word’s made new.
          - For you were there at the foot of the cross,
          - When Jesus died out of love for the lost,
          - His heart was pierced and the fountain flowed free,
          - The source of love, for all eternity.
