  <lyrics>[C]
 Our God is Love. 
 He makes all things new. 
 Our God is Love.
 He makes all things new in you.
 Our God is Love. 
 He makes all things new.
 Open your heart to Him. 
 Open your heart to Him.

[V1]
 I loved you from the start,
 when I created you.
 You were in my heart 
 since the dawn of time.
 To you, I give the earth,
 the flowers and the fields.
 Subdue and make them your joy,
 for love of me.

[V2]
 When you hid from my face 
 and ran away from me,
 When you fled from me 
 to a distant land,
 I came to look for you;
 I called you by your name.
 Come home, I am your father,
 come back to me!

[V3]
 For God so loved the world,
 He gave his only Son,
 So that we might believe
 and be made new.
 There is no greater love, 
 than to lay down your life.
 For us Christ gave up his life,
 unto the cross.

[V4]
 Behold this heart of mine, 
 which loves the world so much
 But in return gets coldness
 and contempt.
 This heart burns for all men, 
 especially for you.
 This is the love you long for:
 you need not fear!

[V5]
 I praise and thank you Lord,
 for your great love for me.
 I put my life entirely 
 in your hands!
 Make my heart like your own, 
 enflame it with your love.
 Receive my heart, I'm ready,
 I trust in you!

[V6]
 Enlighten me, o Lord. 
 Help me to understand
 The breadth, the height 
 and depth of your true love.
 Lord set my heart on fire 
 and send me on the way
 To tell the world of your love,
 o send me Lord!</lyrics>
