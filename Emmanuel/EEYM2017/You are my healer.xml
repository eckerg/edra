  <title>You are my healer</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 I cry to you Father Your Spirit within.
 And though I am weak, your mercy I seek,
 to wash me from all of my sins.
 My Jesus, my Saviour, my Lord and my God,
 my heart's true desire is Your heavenly fire,
 to be with you for ever more.

[V2]
 I'll live by the spirit to be filled with grace.
 O Lord cleanse my soul and come make me whole.
 I long for Your loving embrace.
 I know you are faithful, yet Father I fear.
 Oh when will I see Your power in me?
 And yet I know You're always near.

[C]
 "You are my healer", with the heavens I sing.
 "Hosanna", I'll praise You, my God and my King.
 Glory and power to Your most holy name.

[B]
 Our God saves, and his greatness I'll proclaim.
 Lord we are precious of worth in Your eyes.
 Sonship you gave us by Your sacrifice.
 And in our night, we see Your light
 as grace pours into our lives.

[C2]
 "You are my healer", with the heavens I sing.
 "Hosanna", I'll praise You, my God and my King.
 Glory and power to Your most holy name.
 Our God saves, and his greatness I'll proclaim.</lyrics>
