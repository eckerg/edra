  <title>Hail Queen of Heaven</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 Hail Queen of Heav’n, 
 You are beyond compare,
 Mary, full of grace, enrob’d with the sun,
 Crown’d with the stars the moon is at your feet,
 For our salvation’s dawn, 
 We have received in you.

[V1]
 Mother Mary new Eve, 
 you’re the joy of our Lord,
 You gave birth to our God,
 our Saviour Jesus Christ.
 You have opened to us, 
 all we lost through our sin;
 guide us all on our way,
 bright star of the morn.

[V2]
 Mary, you still believed,
 at the foot of the cross.
 Keep us firm in our hope, 
 protect our faith in Him.
 From the side of your Son,
 you have drawn for us all,
 Streams of life and of grace
 poured out for all the world.

[V3]
 O the great joy of Eve,
 when you were lifted up,
 Higher than all the angels,
 ev’n higher than the clouds.
 Mother Mary our Queen,
 o how great is our joy,
 Contemplating in you 
 the promise of God’s life.

[V4]
 O Immaculate Queen, 
 virgin free from all sin,
 With your body and soul, 
 you entered into heav’n.
 You were carried in glory, 
 Queen of heaven you’re blest,
 You will welcome us all, 
 the day when we see God.</lyrics>
