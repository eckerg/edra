  <lyrics>[V1]
 It is good to acknowledge that your love is true
 And proclaim that our love comes from you.
 All our being we offer to you we belong,
 We, a people of praise, sing this song:

[C]
 Strong, mighty and holy,
 Is your great name.
 May praise ring out before You:
 Endless is your reign.

[V2]
 You have filled us with treasures that come from your hand,
 For the hungry who dwell in this land.
 We give thanks for your goodness, the gifts that you send,
 So our voices proclaim without end:

[V3]
 All your signs and your wonders; your power revealed,
 We proclaim to the world we are healed.
 We come into your presence and humbly adore.
 You are worthy of praise evermore.</lyrics>
