    title: To the boundless deep you lead me
    verses:
      - name: c
        lines:
          - To the boundless deep You lead me,
          - at my side You dispel all my fears.
          - I will praise my rock and  my fortress;
          - O my God you're the strength of my life!
          - To the boundless deep You lead me,
          - in your presence the night disappers.
          - I will praise my rock and  my fortress;
          - O my God you're the strength of my life
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - You are my rock, You are my fortress;
          - You are the one on whom I depend.
          - You have preserved me from falling in darkness,
          - struck off the chains of death from my soul.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - When I cried out in my distresses,
          - You came to save me from my despair.
          - When I was cast into the deepest of dungeons,
          - You came to draw me in to the light!
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - You clothe me, Lord, with your own glory,
          - and with your love You give me your strength.
          - I sing your praise and will bless You for ever;
          - I will not cease to honour your name.
      - name: v4
        lines:
          - For You my God nothing is hopeless;
          - be cause your ways are far above mine.
          - With You alone I can face any danger;
          - in You O Lord I put all my trust.
