  <lyrics>[C]
 Praise to you, let me sing of your love, 
 Spirit of fire, my Lord.
 Glory to you, the world is full of your light: 
 Gloria, alleluia.

[V1]
 Spirit, come! Pour out your rays of light,
 Let them fill me with your love. 
 Come to me, come quickly, come visit my soul; 
 Spirit, come! Enter my heart! 

[V2]
 Spirit, come! Precious gift from on high,
 Come console me with your love. 
 Come and cure the wounds of my soul, heal me Lord; 
 Spirit, come! Enter my heart! 

[V3]
 Spirit, come! Wash away all my fears,
 Fill me with new life in You. 
 Clear the path before me, keep me from all sin; 
 Spirit, come! Enter my heart! 

[V4]
 Spirit, come! Holy fire from above,
 Come and change my heart of stone. 
 Make it burn with love for You, Spirit of truth; 
 Spirit, come! Enter my heart! 

[V5]
 Spirit, come! Come and give me your peace,
 Take my life, set me ablaze, 
 Fill me with your joy, let me sing to your name; 
 Spirit, come! Enter my heart! </lyrics>
