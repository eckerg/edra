    title: Silent Night
    verses:
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Silent night, holy night!
          - All is calm, all is bright.
          - Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child.
          - Holy infant so tender and mild,
          - Sleep in heavenly peace,
          - Sleep in heavenly peace
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - Silent night, holy night!
          - Shepherds quake at the sight.
          - Glories stream from heaven afar
          - Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia,
          - Christ the Savior is born!
          - Christ the Savior is born
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - Silent night, holy night!
          - Son of God love's pure light.
          - Radiant beams from Thy holy face
          - With dawn of redeeming grace,
          - Jesus Lord, at Thy birth
          - Jesus Lord, at Thy birth
