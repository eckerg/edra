  <title>My God, I abandon</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 My God, I abandon my life into your hands.
 Do with me only what You will.
 Iâ€™m ready for all. I accept all things.
 Do what You will, Lord, with my thanks.

[C]
 For You are my Father, my life is in your hands.
 For You are my Father, I put my trust in You.

[V2]
 My God, I entrust everything I have to You,
 In your hands I place my soul.
 With all my heart I offer it to You,
 I have one desire, Your will be done.</lyrics>
