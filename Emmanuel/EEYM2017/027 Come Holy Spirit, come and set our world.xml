  <title>Come Holy Spirit, come and set our world</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 Come, Holy Spirit, 
 Come and set our world on fire!
 Come, Holy Spirit, 
 Come set us ablaze!

[V1]
 Fill us with your love,
 renew in us the faith
 And come, and set our hearts on fire!

[V2]
 Guide in us the truth, 
 reveal to us the Son,
 And come, and set our hearts on fire!

[V3]
 Fill us with your strength 
 and send us in the world,
 And come, and set our hearts on fire!

[V4]
 Power from above, 
 come help us to be free,
 To tell that Jesus is the Lord!</lyrics>
