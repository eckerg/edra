  <title>Into your hands</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 Into your hands I commend my spirit, 
 God my only strength;
 Throughout the night guard me 
 With your watchful power.

[V1]
 Hide me in the shadow of your outstretched wings,
 Keep me safe as the apple of your own eye.

[V2]
 When the light of day is hidden from my eyes,
 Shelter me always in your presence, my Lord.

[V3]
 May your Spirit light the path before my steps,
 In my heart keep the flame of love burning still.

[V4]
 Let not night conceal my grievous sin from me,
 Spread your peace over me till morning is come.

[V5]
 Come, my refuge, come the shelter of my soul,
 Take my thoughts, bind them to your service, o Lord.

[V6]
 When the dawn comes may I still enjoy your grace,
 I will sing, I will praise your glorious name.</lyrics>
