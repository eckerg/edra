  <lyrics>[C]
 Give praise to God’s holy name!
 Give praise, you servants of the Lord!
 Praise the Lord, for he is good!
 Celebrate the gentleness of God!

[V1]
 Come ring out all our joy! Here is our Lord!
 Hail the Lord God our rock, true salvation He brings!
 Let us come unto Him, give Him our thanks,
 With our song and our dance, offer praise to the King!

[V2]
 God is mighty and strong, He is our Lord.
 King above all the gods, all the mountains are his.
 In his hands are the depths, all of the earth,
 And the land and the sea by his own hand were made.

[V3]
 Let us enter his house, bow and bend low.
 Let us kneel before Him, He alone is our God.
 To his pasture we come, He is our guide,
 We belong to the flock that is led by his hand. 

[V4]
 Hear the word of the Lord! Ponder his law!
 Do not harden your hearts, listen now to his voice!
 Keep us close to You, Lord, steadfast and true,
 Strengthen us in our faith: all our hope is in You!</lyrics>
