  <lyrics>[V1]
 Praise the Lord for He is good, alleluia
 And his love, it has no end, alleluia!
 To the East and to the West, alleluia
 Let us proclaim unending love, alleluia!

[C]
 Alleluia! Alleluia, 
 Jubilate Deo!
 Alleluia! Alleluia, 
 Jubilate, alleluia!

[V2]
 The Father longed to send his Son, alleluia
 Out of love for everyone, alleluia!
 Mary said, "Let it be done", alleluia
 So Christ the Lord came to be born, alleluia!

[V3]
 Jesus came to set us free, alleluia
 From our sin and from our strife, alleluia!
 Victory comes from his cross, alleluia
 He feeds us with the Bread of Life, alleluia!

[V4]
 Jesus is alive today, alleluia
 His own heart, true source of love, alleluia!
 Spirit-filled, we go our way, alleluia
 To tell the world that God is Love, alleluia!</lyrics>
