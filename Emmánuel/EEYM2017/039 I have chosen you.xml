  <title>I have chosen you</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 I have chosen you, I have called you by name,
 O that you may go and witness to the world.
 Come and live in me and bear fruit that will last,
 For you’re no longer servants cherished friends.

[V2]
 Contemplate my wounds and my heart that was pierced
 And accept the life I long to give to you.
 Come believe in me, I’m risen from the dead, 
 And when I come in glory you’ll see my face.

[V3]
 Come receive the spirit of power and of peace.
 Witness to my name, for you I gave my life. 
 Do not be afraid of giving up your life. 
 For you are my disciples, my chosen Friends.

[V4]
 Come console my people, their Shepherd is here.
 Share with them the joy that I have given you.
 Show to all you meet the Lord’s own tenderness.
 If you remain in me, then you will have life.</lyrics>
