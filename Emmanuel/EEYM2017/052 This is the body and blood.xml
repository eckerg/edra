  <lyrics>[C]
 This is the body and blood of our Lord. 
 The cup of our salvation and the bread of life. 
 Eternal God gives Himself as our food 
 That all who believe in Him may have life.

[V1]
 Just before the Lord went to the Father 
 He took bread and wine, broke it for us. 
 Through the gift of His blood and His body, 
 We know we will not hunger again.

[V2]
 Jesus shares Himself for all the nations, 
 He is the bread of life for the world.
 And through Him we are now all God’s children.
 In His sacrifice He’s glorified.

[V3]
 With the eyes of our Faith we see Jesus,
 Truly here in the bread and the wine. 
 By His dying and rising we’re now free,
 To give all of our life to our King!

[V4]
 Let us sing out our praises unending, 
 For the marvels that He’s done for us.
 Through His body and blood which is given, 
 Jesus pours His own love in our hearts.</lyrics>
