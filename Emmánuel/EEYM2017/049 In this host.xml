  <title>In this host</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Behold, beloved of the Father,
 Son He has given up to save the world;
 In our midst, He became man like us,
 Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.

[C]
 In this host, receive Christ the Saviour,
 God concealed in form of bread.
 Blessed servants of the living Lord,
 Rest only on his Heart, learn everything from Him.

[V2]
 In love You took our human weakness,
 Took the condition of a slave for us:
 King of kings, but You knelt before your servants 
 To wash the feet of men.

[V3]
 How great this mystery, O Master!
 How may my heart receive your endless love?
 Though I sin in my body and my soul, 
 You have come to dwell in me.

[V4]
 On You alone my hope is founded;
 Wash not my feet alone but cleanse my soul.
 From your heart pour the Spirit on my dryness;
 The water of new life.

[V5]
 You call me, Lord, to be your servant,
 Yet in my weakness I depend on You.
 May my heart be a dwelling-place for You, 
 Ever burning with your love.</lyrics>
