  <lyrics>[C]
 Stay silent,
 unless what you have to say
 is greater than the beauty
 of the silence of the Lord.
 
 Stay silent,
 unless what you have to say
 is greater than the silence of the Lord.

[V1]
 Draw me Jesus to the silence of your heart;
 take me away from my fears.
 Many worries of the world hinder me;
 here in your presence they leave me.

[V2]
 All my being finds itself in Your truth.
 I see the scars of my sins, Lord;
 revelation of my woundednature.
 All of my heart longs for You, Lord.

[V3]
 Help me Jesus find my true desires,
 settle the storm of my emo tions.
 Enlighten my mind with Your wisdom di vine,
 to know Your will for my life, Lord.

[V4]
 Here you look with so much love upon me;
 Your love and mercy sets me free.
 I lift my eyes adoring to your face,
 and see the beauty of Your grace.</lyrics>
