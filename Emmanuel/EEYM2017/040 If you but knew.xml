  <lyrics>[C]
 If you but knew all that God gives, 
 You would be asking for water from me.
 I am your God, source of your life. 
 Come now and rest on my heart.

[V1]
 I am the God who has made you.
 I shaped you and formed you in your motherâ€™s womb.
 I give you all what you need 
 For each day of your life. There is no need to fear.

[V2]
 If you should pass through deep waters,
 Encountering death, I will always be there.
 You are my chosen one, Israel.
 I take you by the hand. I am with you.

[V3]
 I am the God of your Fathers, the Saviour,
 Creator of all that was made.
 I set the stars in the heavens,
 Established the universe. I am your God.

[V4]
 I march in front of you, challenge the mighty
 And throw down their high city walls.
 I break the chains that have bound you.
 I level the mountains and trace you a path.

[V5]
 I open to you the treasures that come from my kingdom,
 Unknown to the wise.
 People of Israel, worship me humbly,
 Acknowledge that I am your God.</lyrics>
