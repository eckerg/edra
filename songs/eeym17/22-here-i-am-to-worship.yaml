    title: Here I am to worship
    verses:
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Light of the world
          - You stepped down into darkness
          - Opened my eyes, let me see
          - Beauty that made this heart adore You
          - Hope of a life spent with You
      - name: c
        lines:
          - Here I am to worship
          - Here I am to bow down
          - Here I am to say that You're my God
          - You're altogether lovely
          - Altogether worthy
          - Altogether wonderful to me
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - King of all days
          - Oh so highly exalted
          - Glorious in heaven above
          - Humbly You came to the earth You created
          - All for love's sake became poor
      - name: b
        lines:
          - I'll never know how much it cost
          - To see my sin upon that cross
