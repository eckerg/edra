  <lyrics>[C]
 God's own Son 
 Came down from heaven. 
 He is called Emmanuel. 
 God's own Son 
 Came down from heaven. 
 Alleluia!

[V1]
 Jesus Christ, You are our Saviour.
 Son of God and king eternal.  
 As a man, You came to save us.
 You are God with us.

[V2]
 Jesus when You came among us,
 You were placed into a manger.
 Stripped of all your heav'nly glory, 
 You are God with us. 

[V3]
 God from God and light from true light.
 Truly one with God the Father,
 With no end, with no beginning,
 He is God with us.

[V4]
 Jesus is the light to follow.
 Shining forth for all the nations
 Jesus takes away our worries,
 He is God with us.

[V5]
 When our hearts are feeling heavy,
 Burdened with life's care and worries
 Jesus, You are there to lead us,
 You are God with us.</lyrics>
