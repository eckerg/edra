  <title>Lord, You Know Me</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord, you know me, and you search the secrets of my heart.
 Sometimes I run and try to hide
 though you're here by my side.
 My aching heart, this weary pain,
 Lord, I call your holy name.
 You know when I sit and when I rise,
 tender love shining from your eyes.

[C]
 And you say:
 I know. I know.
 I died for you, I rose for you,
 my Spirit I gave to you.

[V2]
 Lord, you know me, and you search the secrets of my heart.
 Sometimes I run and try to hide
 though you're here by my side.
 You don't condemn but you guide,
 darkness can't hide from love divine.
 Oh, Spirit of power, on me descend;
 my sinful soul, you be friend.

[V3]
 Lord, you know me, and you search the secrets of my heart.
 Sometimes I run and try to hide
 though you're here by my side.
 Eternal life, I purely seek,
 Open my heart when I am weak
 so if my steps should go astray;
 lead me in your eternal way.

[V32]
 For I shall not be afraid,
 I'm wonderfully made.
 Wonderfully made, wonderfully made,
 wonderfully made am I.
 Wonderfully made, wonderfully made,
 wonderfully made am I.

[C2]
 'Cause I know. I know.
 You died for me. You rose for me.
 Your Spirit sets me free.
