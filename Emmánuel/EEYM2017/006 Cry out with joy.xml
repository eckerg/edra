  <title>Cry out with joy</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 Cry out with joy all you children of God, 
 All you who thirst, all you humble of heart! 
 Open your eyes, see the kingdom is here. 
 Welcome your Saviour and Lord. 

[V1]
 All of my life, I will sing to the Lord.
 Always his praise will remain on my lips. 
 With all my heart, I will honour the Lord. 
 Let all the humble rejoice! 

[V2]
 Turn to the Lord, fix your eyes on his face.
 Hope in our God, he will free you from shame. 
 Happy the poor for he answers their prayer. 
 He rescues them from distress! 

[V3]
 Join me in praise, tell the wonders of God.
 Let us exult in his glorious name.
 I seek the Lord and he answers my call, 
 He sets me free from my fears! </lyrics>
