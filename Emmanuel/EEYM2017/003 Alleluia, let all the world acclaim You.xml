  <title>Alleluia, let all the world acclaim You</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Let all the world acclaim You,
 And with full voice sing praise.
 Your misery He’s taken,
 And on the Cross He’s raised.
 The God of all your fathers,
 Who fights for you this day,
 Let all the world acclaim You,
 Sing out in joyful praise:

[C]
 Alleluia, alleluia,
 Alleluia, alleluia.

[V2]
 He’s worked so many wonders,
 Almighty God is He,
 Forever faithful His love,
 His chosen children we.
 At the blast of the trumpet,
 All instruments as one, 
 The world exults in glory,
 And praises Him in song:

[V3]
 He is King of all peoples,
 And in the world He reigns.
 I place my hope in His Word,
 To free me from my chains.
 Let the sea and its creatures,
 The mountains and the plains,
 Forever sing His glory
 And repeat in refrain: </lyrics>
