          - I see a generation
          - Rising up to take their place
          - With selfless faith
          - With selfless faith
          - I see a near revival
          - Stirring as we pray and seek
          - We’re on our knees
          - We’re on our knees

          - Heal my heart and make it clean
          - Open up my eyes to the things unseen
          - Show me how to love
          - Like You have loved me
          - Break my heart for what breaks Yours
          - Everything I am
          - For Your kingdom’s cause
          - As I walk from earth into eternity
