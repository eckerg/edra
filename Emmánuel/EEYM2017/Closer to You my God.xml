  <title>Closer to You my God</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 Closer to You, my God,
 I long to dwell in You,
 my creator and Lord,
 You made me for yourself
 and my heart's without rest,
 until it finds rest in You.

[V1]
 Who but You can fulfill, 
 the desires of my heart,
 satisfying search
 for an all perfect love?
 Who if not You O Lord,
 God of goodness and grace
 You the absoolute love
 that has been for all time?

[V2]
 May You show me your love,
 all the days of my life.
 Without You by my side,
 I just stumble and fall.
 May your Spirit of love,
 fill my heart with your fire,
 may I learn how to give
 love and always forgive.

[V3]
 At the end of my life
 may You welcome me Lord,
 in your heart full of love
 in the Father's own house.
 May I see You O Lord,
 contemplate You with joy,
 live in heaven with You
 in your love without end.</lyrics>
