  <lyrics>[C]
 Take and eat: 
 This is my body. 
 Take and drink: this is my blood.
 Open your heart! 
 I give my life. I am with you 
 Until the end of time!

[V1]
 Come dwell in me, as I dwell in you.
 Just as the Father has loved me, so I love you.
 No love is greater than a love that gives its all. 
 No longer servants, I call you my friends.

[V2]
 Ask in my name, what you ask I will do.
 Then you will know the love my Father has for you.
 I give my Spirit, He will help you on your way.
 Do not be troubled. My peace be with you!

[V3]
 I pray for them so that they may be one.
 One in us Father, just as you and I are one.
 May they discover the love you have for me.
 May they discover your love dwells in them!
