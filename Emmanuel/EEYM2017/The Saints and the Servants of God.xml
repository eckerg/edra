  <title>The Saints and the Servants of God</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 The saints and the servants of God,
 go up to the heavenly throne.
 With a great song of praise,
 they rejoice in the Lord who is maker of all.

[V1]
 I saw the glory of God,
 shining out in all its power.
 Endless joy rings out
 in the new Jerusalem!
 Holy Lord, Holy Lord!

[V2]
 I saw the Lamb who was slain,
 shining brighter than a star.
 Saviour of the world,
 He is worthy of all praise!
 Holy Lord, Holy Lord!

[V3]
 I saw the Spirit of God,
 coming from the Father's hand.
 Light of all our lives,
 it is sonship that He gives!
 Holy Lord, Holy Lord!</lyrics>
