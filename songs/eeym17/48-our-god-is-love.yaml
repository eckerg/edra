          - Our God is Love.
          - He makes all things new.
          - Our God is Love.
          - He makes all things new in you.
          - Our God is Love.

      - name: v1
        lines:
          - I loved you from the start,
          - when I created you.
          - You were in my heart
          - since the dawn of time.
          - To you, I give the earth,
          - the flowers and the fields.
          - Subdue and make them your joy,
          - for love of me.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - When you hid from my face
          - and ran away from me,
          - When you fled from me
          - to a distant land,
          - I came to look for you;
          - I called you by your name.
          - Come home, I am your father,
          - come back to me!
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - For God so loved the world,
          - He gave his only Son,
          - So that we might believe
          - and be made new.
          - There is no greater love,
          - than to lay down your life.
          - For us Christ gave up his life,
          - unto the cross.
      - name: v4
        lines:
          - Behold this heart of mine,
          - which loves the world so much
          - But in return gets coldness
          - and contempt.
          - This heart burns for all men,
          - especially for you.
          - 'This is the love you long for:'
          - you need not fear!
      - name: v5
        lines:
          - I praise and thank you Lord,
          - for your great love for me.
          - I put my life entirely
          - in your hands!
          - Make my heart like your own,
          - enflame it with your love.
          - Receive my heart, I'm ready,
          - I trust in you!
      - name: v6
        lines:
          - Enlighten me, o Lord.
          - Help me to understand
          - The breadth, the height
          - and depth of your true love.
          - Lord set my heart on fire
          - and send me on the way
          - To tell the world of your love,
          - o send me Lord!
