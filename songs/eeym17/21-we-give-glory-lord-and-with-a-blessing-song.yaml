    title: We give glory, Lord, And with a blessing song
    verses:
      - name: c
        lines:
          - We give glory, Lord,
          - And with a blessing song,
          - Little children sure
          - Of their Fatherâ€™s love,
          - We proclaim our hope,
          - Voices joined as one,
          - Together honour your name.
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Holy Lord, You stretch out your hand,
          - Giving life and hope to the earth.
          - In the night, the true light shines out,
          - Word of God, the lamp of our path!
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - Let the peoples sing out their joy,
          - Let the nations follow your ways,
          - 'Let the priests proclaim your decrees:'
          - Bless, o Lord, this people of praise.
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - As the earth has yielded its fruit,
          - So our God has blessed us once more.
          - From the dawn to setting of sun,
          - Let the nations come to adore.
