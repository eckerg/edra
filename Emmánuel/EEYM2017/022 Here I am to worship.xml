  <title>Here I am to worship</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Light of the world
 You stepped down into darkness
 Opened my eyes, let me see
 Beauty that made this heart adore You
 Hope of a life spent with You

[C]
 Here I am to worship
 Here I am to bow down
 Here I am to say that You're my God
 You're altogether lovely
 Altogether worthy
 Altogether wonderful to me

[V2]
 King of all days
 Oh so highly exalted
 Glorious in heaven above
 Humbly You came to the earth You created
 All for love's sake became poor

[B]
 I'll never know how much it cost
 To see my sin upon that cross
