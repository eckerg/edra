  <lyrics>[V1]
 In the upper room, gathered here with Mary
 We lift up our eyes to You, Lord.
 Pour your glory down, fill us with your splendour, 
 Set our hearts alight with your fire.

[C]
 Come, Spirit of God, 
 O breath come from the Most High.
 Descend on us, flame of his love; 
 O come, burn always in us.

[V2]
 To our sinful souls, come Creator Spirit,
 Come and fill our hearts with your grace.
 Give your seven gifts, loose our tongues to praise You,
 Let us tell the world of your love!

[V3]
 Fill our hearts with love for our brothers round us;
 Make of us one body on earth.
 Take our humble praise, change it by your power,
 Let us be renewed in your joy</lyrics>
