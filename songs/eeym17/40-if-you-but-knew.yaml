          - If you but knew all that God gives,

          - I shaped you and formed you in your motherâ€™s womb.

          - If you should pass through deep waters,
          - Encountering death, I will always be there.

          - I march in front of you, challenge the mighty

          - Acknowledge that I am your God.
