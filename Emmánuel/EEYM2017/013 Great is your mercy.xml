  <title>Great is your mercy</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 Great is your mercy, wonderful your love! 
 Great is your mercy, infinite your love! 
 God of compassion, 
 I will never cease to sing your praise! 

[V1]
 You, o Lord, are a merciful God,
 Your compassion is true. 
 Slow to anger and faithful in love, 
 You seek for the lost to save them from sin. 

[V2]
 All the poor fix their eyes upon you.
 You give hope in despair. 
 To the needy, you open your hands. 
 You fill them, o Lord, with life to the full. 

[V3]
 All my heart offers thanks to my God,
 Worships his holy name. 
 I will tell of his marvellous deeds, 
 A new song of praise each day of my life. </lyrics>
