  <title>And I want to say I love you</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 O Mother Mary, your love is so true.
 Its faithfulness draws me closer to you.
 And when I cry and I’m lost from the fold.
 I know that you will never lose your hold.

 You gave your “Yes” to the Word of the Lord.
 And God himself in your womb took his form.
 Now that you’re crowned in the heavens above,
 You’ll carry me home by the grace of his love.

[C]
 And I want to say "I love you".
 And I need to say "I love you".
 Now just let me say that I’ll love you
 For all eternity.
 For all eternity.

[V2]
 God’s call, at times, seems so daunting to me.
 I ask myself how it ever will be.
 But when I ponder the Gospel with you,
 You give me faith and his Word’s made new.

 For you were there at the foot of the cross,
 When Jesus died out of love for the lost,
 His heart was pierced and the fountain flowed free,
 The source of love, for all eternity.</lyrics>
