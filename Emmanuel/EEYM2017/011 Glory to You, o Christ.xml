  <title>Glory to You, o Christ</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 Glory to You, o Christ, 
 The Churchâ€™s one true Shepherd! 
 You are the true and joyful 
 Light that gives us life!

[V1]
 Star of evening shining bright,
 In the glory of the Father, 
 In your light we see the Light 
 And in You we have our being!

[V2]
 Let our voices praise your name
 And proclaim You to the nations. 
 You are true God from true God 
 Come to lead us to the Father!

[V3]
 Send your Spirit on us, Lord.
 Let your grace shine down upon us. 
 Take our world of dark and sin; 
 Make of it a new creation!

[V4]
 As we lift our hands on high
 And we offer You our praises, 
 Take our hearts, our hope, our lives, 
 And transform us for your glory!

[V5]
 Lord, accept our evensong
 As the incense fills the temple, 
 As we bow before your throne, 
 Only Son, one with the Father!</lyrics>
