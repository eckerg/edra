  <title>Come, proclaim the King of Heaven</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 Come, proclaim the King of Heav’n 
 and give glory to his name!
 Come, adore Emmanuel! 
 God is with us ev’ry day.
 He has set our hearts ablaze,
 with the Holy Spirit’s flame.
 Let us praise our saving Lord,
 as we place our hope in Him!

[V1]
 Jesus has revealed his heart, 
 afire with love for us.
 We adore Him,
 we see his power near.
 Let us rejoice!

[V2]
 Jesus showed compassion 
 for us high upon the Cross,
 And we love Him, 
 we love his Holy Name.
 Let us rejoice!

[V3]
 We can see his Kingdom,
 we have heard his Holy Word.
 We proclaim Him, 
 for Jesus is alive.
 Let us rejoice!</lyrics>
