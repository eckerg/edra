    verses:
      - name: c
        lines:
          - The saints and the servants of God,
          - go up to the heavenly throne.
          - With a great song of praise,
          - they rejoice in the Lord who is maker of all.
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - I saw the glory of God,
          - shining out in all its power.
          - Endless joy rings out
          - in the new Jerusalem!
          - Holy Lord, Holy Lord!
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - I saw the Lamb who was slain,
          - shining brighter than a star.
          - Saviour of the world,
          - He is worthy of all praise!
          - Holy Lord, Holy Lord!
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - I saw the Spirit of God,
          - coming from the Father's hand.
          - Light of all our lives,
          - it is sonship that He gives!
          - Holy Lord, Holy Lord!
