    verses:
      - name: c
        lines:
          - For all your marvels,
          - I want to sing your Name,
          - Tell of your wonders to the world.
          - In You I put my trust,
          - In You and You alone,
          - You are the Saviour I adore.
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - For when I call You in grief or sadness,
          - You hear my cry, You draw close to me.
          - With your right hand You comfort and protect me.
          - In your embrace You hold me safely.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - Into your hands Lord, I give my spirit,
          - And I abandon myself to You.
          - Who else can save and pardon our transgression?
          - Only from You comes true salvation.
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - Far from your presence I cannot live, Lord.
          - But let your face shine always on me.
          - Don't disappoint the hope I have in You, Lord.
          - Forever I will sing your praises.
