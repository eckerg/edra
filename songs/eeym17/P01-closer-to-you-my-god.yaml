      - name: c
        lines:
          - Closer to You, my God,
          - I long to dwell in You,
          - my creator and Lord,
          - You made me for yourself
          - and my heart's without rest,
          - until it finds rest in You.
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Who but You can fulfill,
          - the desires of my heart,
          - satisfying search
          - for an all perfect love?
          - Who if not You O Lord,
          - God of goodness and grace
          - You the absoolute love
          - that has been for all time?
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - May You show me your love,
          - all the days of my life.
          - Without You by my side,
          - I just stumble and fall.
          - May your Spirit of love,
          - fill my heart with your fire,
          - may I learn how to give
          - love and always forgive.
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - At the end of my life
          - may You welcome me Lord,
          - in your heart full of love
          - in the Father's own house.
          - May I see You O Lord,
          - contemplate You with joy,
          - live in heaven with You
          - in your love without end.
