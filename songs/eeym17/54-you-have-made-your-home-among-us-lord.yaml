    title: You have made your home among us, Lord
    verses:
      - name: c
        lines:
          - You have placed your body in our hands.
          - Humble servant, least among all men,
          - Holy One of God and poorest of the poor,
          - You have made your home among us, Lord.
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - The bread you give to eat,
          - the wine you give to drink,
          - Is your body and blood.
          - You offer up your life,
          - your heart is pierced for us.
          - You have made your home among us, Lord.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - In this communion, Lord,
          - you come to dwell in us,
          - Burning furnace of love.
          - The heart that loved so
          - much is thirsty for our hearts.
          - You have made your home among us, Lord.
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - The life we have received
          - 'transforms our hearts of stone:'
          - Tabernacles of Christ.
          - You send us to the world
          - to reach out to the lost.
          - You have made your home among us, Lord.
