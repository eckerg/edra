      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Let all the world acclaim You,
          - And with full voice sing praise.
          - Your misery He’s taken,
          - And on the Cross He’s raised.
          - The God of all your fathers,
          - Who fights for you this day,
          - Let all the world acclaim You,
          - 'Sing out in joyful praise:'

      - name: v2
        lines:
          - He’s worked so many wonders,
          - Almighty God is He,
          - Forever faithful His love,
          - His chosen children we.
          - At the blast of the trumpet,
          - All instruments as one,
          - The world exults in glory,
          - 'And praises Him in song:'
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - He is King of all peoples,
          - And in the world He reigns.
          - I place my hope in His Word,
          - To free me from my chains.
          - Let the sea and its creatures,
          - The mountains and the plains,
          - Forever sing His glory
          - 'And repeat in refrain:'
