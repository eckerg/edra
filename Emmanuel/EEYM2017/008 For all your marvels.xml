  <title>For all your marvels</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 For all your marvels, 
 I want to sing your Name,
 Tell of your wonders to the world.
 In You I put my trust, 
 In You and You alone,
 You are the Saviour I adore.

[V1]
 For when I call You in grief or sadness,
 You hear my cry, You draw close to me.
 With your right hand You comfort and protect me.
 In your embrace You hold me safely.

[V2]
 Into your hands Lord, I give my spirit,
 And I abandon myself to You.
 Who else can save and pardon our transgression?
 Only from You comes true salvation.

[V3]
 Far from your presence I cannot live, Lord.
 But let your face shine always on me.
 Don't disappoint the hope I have in You, Lord.
 Forever I will sing your praises.</lyrics>
