  <title>The Stand</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 You stood before creation
 Eternity within Your hands
 You spoke all life into motion
 My soul now to stand

[V2]
 You stood before my failure
 And carried the cross for my shame
 My sin weighed upon Your shoulders
 My soul now to stand

[P]
 So what can I say
 And what could I do
 But offer this heart O God
 Completely to You

[V3]
 So I'll walk upon salvation
 Your Spirit alive in me
 This life to declare Your promise
 My soul now to stand

[C]
 So I'll stand
 With arms high and heart abandoned
 In awe of the One who gave it all
 I'll stand
 My soul Lord to You surrendered
 All I am is Yours
