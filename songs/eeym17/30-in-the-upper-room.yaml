    title: In the upper room
    verses:
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - In the upper room, gathered here with Mary
          - We lift up our eyes to You, Lord.
          - Pour your glory down, fill us with your splendour,
          - Set our hearts alight with your fire.
      - name: c
        lines:
          - Come, Spirit of God,
          - O breath come from the Most High.
          - Descend on us, flame of his love;
          - O come, burn always in us.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - To our sinful souls, come Creator Spirit,
          - Come and fill our hearts with your grace.
          - Give your seven gifts, loose our tongues to praise You,
          - Let us tell the world of your love!
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - Fill our hearts with love for our brothers round us;
          - Make of us one body on earth.
          - Take our humble praise, change it by your power,
          - Let us be renewed in your joy.
