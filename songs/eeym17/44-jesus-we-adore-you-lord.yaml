          - For life has made itself known.
          - In the dark of our sin, light has shown,

          - Jesus, true God and true man.
          - You became one of us, Maryâ€™s child.
          - Emmanuel, God-is-with-us,
          - You make your dwelling in our midst.

        lines:
          - Jesus, the Lamb who was slain,
          - Let us gaze on your heart, pierced for us.
          - Spirit of God flows from the cross,
          - Water of life that makes us whole.
      - name: v4
        lines:
          - Jesus, from out of the tomb,
          - You have overcome death, God of life!
          - Body of Christ, broken for us,
          - We come to worship and adore.
