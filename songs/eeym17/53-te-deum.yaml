          - Striding forward prophets and saints,
          - White robed martyrs strong like an army,
          - All bow down before your throne.
          - On the earth your Church acclaims You,

          - Holy Spirit advocate and guide.

          - Christ You are the king of all glory,
          - Sign of God’s eternal love,
          - You became man for our salvation,
          - From a virgin’s womb You were born.
          - You defeated death in the tomb,
          - opened up the gates of heaven,
          - Seated at the right of the Father,
          - You will judge the living and the dead.

          - By the precious gift of your blood,
          - Save your people, hear our call.
          - Keep us free from sin and stain,
          - Grant a place for us with the saints,
          - Be our ruler, be our Lord,
          - we have placed our hope in You,
          - May we stand before your throne,
          - Giving glory for eternity!
