    title: In our darkness is risen a light
    verses:
      - name: c
        lines:
          - In our darkness is risen a light,
          - the new light of Christ has dawned.
          - It will shine for all eyes to see,
          - it will live in every heart.
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Let the desert blossom once more,
          - let it ring with songs of great joy;
          - for the springs and the fountains
          - bring new life to the barren land.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - You shall see the glory of God,
          - and the majesty of the Lord;
          - Say to all the faint hearts,
          - do not fear, our God has come to save.
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - He has come to bring us new life,
          - let your hearts receive him in joy,
          - For God loves us so much,
          - he has come to ransom us from death.
