    title: Lord, in your mercy, guide us home
    verses:
      - name: c
        lines:
          - Lord in your mercy guide us home.
          - Your Word, a light along our path.
          - Keep us together as one in love;
          - a people of healing and peace.
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Weighed down with sin, Lord, we hid in fear,
          - but in our shame you were near.
          - You took our burdens, you set us free, Lord,
          - and forever we'll sing of your love.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - 'Amazing love that you have for us:'
          - such love that conquered sin and death.
          - Upon that cross, Lord, water and blood poured;
          - from your side you had fashioned the Church!
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - Your mighty deeds will be known to all;
          - and so the splendour of your reign.
          - For by your victory, filled with your Spirit
          - we go out and proclaim the Good News!
      - name: b
        lines:
          - You are the way. You are the truth. You are the life.
          - You are the way. You are the truth. You are the life.
