          - Glory to You, o Christ,
          - The Churchâ€™s one true Shepherd!
          - You are the true and joyful
          - Light that gives us life!
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Star of evening shining bright,
          - In the glory of the Father,
          - In your light we see the Light
          - And in You we have our being!
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - Let our voices praise your name
          - And proclaim You to the nations.
          - You are true God from true God
          - Come to lead us to the Father!
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - Send your Spirit on us, Lord.
          - Let your grace shine down upon us.
          - Take our world of dark and sin;
          - Make of it a new creation!
      - name: v4
        lines:
          - As we lift our hands on high
          - And we offer You our praises,
          - Take our hearts, our hope, our lives,
          - And transform us for your glory!
      - name: v5
        lines:
          - Lord, accept our evensong
          - As the incense fills the temple,
          - As we bow before your throne,
          - Only Son, one with the Father!
