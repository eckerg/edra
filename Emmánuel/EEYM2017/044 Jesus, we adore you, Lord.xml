  <title>Jesus, we adore you, Lord</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 Jesus, we adore you, Lord,
 Jesus, we adore you, Lord,
 Jesus, we adore you, Lord,
 We adore you.

[V1]
 For life has made itself known.
 In the dark of our sin, light has shown, 
 The Son of God, given for us
 We come to worship and adore.

[V2]
 Jesus, true God and true man. 
 You became one of us, Maryâ€™s child. 
 Emmanuel, God-is-with-us, 
 You make your dwelling in our midst.	

[V3]
 Jesus, the Lamb who was slain,	
 Let us gaze on your heart, pierced for us. 
 Spirit of God flows from the cross, 
 Water of life that makes us whole.	

[V4]
 Jesus, from out of the tomb, 
 You have overcome death, God of life! 
 Body of Christ, broken for us, 
 We come to worship and adore.	</lyrics>
