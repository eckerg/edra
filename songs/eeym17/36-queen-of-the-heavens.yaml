        lines:
          - Queen of the heavens,
          - sing for joy; Alleluia!
          - For He whom you bore
          - in your womb, Alleluia!
          - From the dead He rose,
          - as He promised that He would;
          - Pray for us all,
          - Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia!
