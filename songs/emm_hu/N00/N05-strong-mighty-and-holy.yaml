          - It is good to acknowledge that your love is true
          - And proclaim that our love comes from you.

          - 'We, a people of praise, sing this song:'
      - name: c
        lines:
          - Strong, mighty and holy,
          - Is your great name.

          - Endless is your reign.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - You have filled us with treasures that come from your hand,
          - For the hungry who dwell in this land.

          - 'So our voices proclaim without end:'
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - All your signs and your wonders; your power revealed,
          - We proclaim to the world we are healed.
          - We come into your presence and humbly adore.
          - You are worthy of praise evermore.
