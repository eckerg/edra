  <title>In our darkness is risen a light</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 In our darkness is risen a light,
 the new light of Christ has dawned.
 It will shine for all eyes to see,
 it will live in every heart.

[v1]
 Let the desert blossom once more,
 let it ring with songs of great joy;
 for the springs and the fountains 
 bring new life to the barren land.

[v2]
 You shall see the glory of God, 
 and the majesty of the Lord;
 Say to all the faint hearts,
 do not fear, our God has come to save.

[v3]
 He has come to bring us new life,
 let your hearts receive him in joy,
 For God loves us so much,
 he has come to ransom us from death.</lyrics>
