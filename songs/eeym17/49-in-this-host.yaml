    verses:
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - Behold, beloved of the Father,
          - Son He has given up to save the world;
          - In our midst, He became man like us,
          - Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.
      - name: c
        lines:
          - In this host, receive Christ the Saviour,
          - God concealed in form of bread.
          - Blessed servants of the living Lord,
          - Rest only on his Heart, learn everything from Him.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - In love You took our human weakness,
          - 'Took the condition of a slave for us:'
          - King of kings, but You knelt before your servants
          - To wash the feet of men.
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - How great this mystery, O Master!
          - How may my heart receive your endless love?
          - Though I sin in my body and my soul,
          - You have come to dwell in me.
      - name: v4
        lines:
          - On You alone my hope is founded;
          - Wash not my feet alone but cleanse my soul.
          - From your heart pour the Spirit on my dryness;
          - The water of new life.
      - name: v5
        lines:
          - You call me, Lord, to be your servant,
          - Yet in my weakness I depend on You.
          - May my heart be a dwelling-place for You,
          - Ever burning with your love.
