    title: I have chosen you
    verses:
      - name: v1
        lines:
          - I have chosen you, I have called you by name,
          - O that you may go and witness to the world.
          - Come and live in me and bear fruit that will last,
          - For you’re no longer servants cherished friends.
      - name: v2
        lines:
          - Contemplate my wounds and my heart that was pierced
          - And accept the life I long to give to you.
          - Come believe in me, I’m risen from the dead,
          - And when I come in glory you’ll see my face.
      - name: v3
        lines:
          - Come receive the spirit of power and of peace.
          - Witness to my name, for you I gave my life.
          - Do not be afraid of giving up your life.
          - For you are my disciples, my chosen Friends.
      - name: v4
        lines:
          - Come console my people, their Shepherd is here.
          - Share with them the joy that I have given you.
          - Show to all you meet the Lord’s own tenderness.
          - If you remain in me, then you will have life.
